            apart? Mitsuha is the daughter of the mayor of a small mountain
            town. She's a straightforward high school girl who lives with her
            sister and her grandmother and has no qualms about letting it be
            known that she's uninterested in Shinto rituals or helping her
            father's electoral campaign. Instead she dreams of leaving the
            boring town and trying her luck in Tokyo. Taki is a high school boy
            in Tokyo who works part-time in an Italian restaurant and aspires to
            become an architect or an artist. Every night he has a strange dream

            chance to finally meet. But try as they might, something more
            daunting than distance prevents them. Is the string of fate between

          <h2>Your Lie in April</h2>
          <p>
            Your Lie in April ('April is Your Lie') is a Japanese romantic drama
            manga series that was written and illustrated by Naoshi Arakawa, and
            has been adapted into an anime television series, a live-action
            movie, a light novel, and multiple stage productions. The manga was
            serialized in Kodansha's magazine Monthly Shōnen Magazine from April
            2011 to February 2015. The story follows a young pianist named Kо̄sei
            Arima, who loses the ability to perform the piano after his mother's
            death, and his experiences after he meets violinist Kaori
            Miyazono.The manga series originated from a one-shot comic that
            Arakawa entered in a competition; he based the series on it and drew
            inspiration from the existence of musical manga, such as Beck and
            Nodame Cantabile. A-1 Pictures adapted Your Lie in April into an
            anime television series that was aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina block
            from October 2014 to March 2015, and an original video animation
            (OVA) episode was released in May 2015. A live-action film
            adaptation of the same name was released in September 2016. Your Lie
            in April received mixed reviews; several critics praised its plot
            and characters but criticized the artwork. Critics largely acclaimed
            the anime adaptation for its plot, animation, and soundtrack.
            Fourteen-year-old piano prodigy Kōsei Arima becomes famous after
            winning several music competitions. When his mother Saki dies, Kōsei
            has a mental breakdown while performing at a piano recital; this
            results in him becoming unable to hear the sound of his piano, even
            though his hearing is otherwise unaffected.Two years later, Kōsei
            has not touched the piano and views the world in monochrome. He does
            not focus on excelling in any activities and often spends time with
            his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryōta Watari. Kōsei meets Kaori
            Miyazono, an audacious, free-spirited, fourteen-year-old violinist
            whose playing style reflects her manic personality. Kaori helps
            Kōsei return to playing the piano and shows him his playing style
            can be free and groundbreaking. As Kaori continues to uplift Kōsei's
            spirits, he quickly realizes he loves her, although she seems to
            only be interested in Ryōta. During a performance, Kaori, who later
            explains that she is anemic and needs routine testing, collapses and
            is hospitalized. She invites Kōsei to play with her at a gala but
            she does not arrive. Her health deteriorates and she becomes
            dejected. Kōsei plays a duet with a friend, which motivates Kaori to
            attempt a risky and potentially deadly surgery so she may possibly
            play with Kosei once more. While playing in the finals of the
            Eastern Japan Piano Competition, Kōsei sees Kaori's spirit
            accompanying him and realizes she has died during the surgery.At her
            funeral, Kaori's parents give Kōsei a letter from Kaori that reveals
            she was aware of her impending death and became more free-spirited,
            both as a person and in her music, so she would not take her regrets
            to Heaven. She confesses she had been in love with Kōsei's piano
            playing since watching him perform at a concert when she was five.
            This inspired her to play the violin so she could play with him one
            day. Kaori fabricated her feelings towards Ryōta so she could get
            closer to Kōsei without hurting Tsubaki, who harbored affection for
            Kōsei. She then confesses her love for him. Tsubaki comforts Kōsei
            and tells him she will be by his side. Kaori also leaves behind a
            picture of herself as a child, coming back from the concert that
            inspired her, with Kōsei in the background. Kōsei later frames this
            picture.

            Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with
            his family in the mountains. He became his family's breadwinner
            after his father's death, making trips to the nearby village to sell
            charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover
            that his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and
            his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with
            Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly
            showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with
            Giyū Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro
            is recruited by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji
            Urokodaki for training to also become a demon slayer, beginning his
            quest to help his sister turn into human again and avenge the death
            of his family. After two years of strenuous training, Tanjiro takes
            part in a formidable exam and is one of the few survivors to pass,
            officially making him a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. He begins
            his work of hunting down and slaying demons alongside Nezuko, who
            has been hypnotized to bring no harm to humans and who occasionally
            helps him in battle. One of Tanjiro's assignments brings him to
            Asakusa where he encounters Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all
            demons and the one who murdered his family. He also meets Tamayo and
            Yushiro, demons who are free from Muzan's control. Tamayo and
            Yushiro ally with Tanjiro and begin to develop a cure for Nezuko,
            though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood from the
            Twelve Kizuki, the most powerful demons under Muzan's command.
            Continuing his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke
            Hashibira, fellow survivors of the exam with whom he forms an
            unlikely team during a battle with the former Lower Rank Six of the
            Kizuki. The group soon face off against Lower Rank Five of the
            Kizuki, but are ultimately outmatched; they are rescued by Giyū and
            brought back to headquarters. There, the Kamado siblings partake in
            a council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer
            Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps' most elite members, who (with the
            exception of Giyū) do not believe that Nezuko should be allowed to
            live. However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept
            her. With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the
            Hashira, where he encounters significantly more resistance from the
            demons.Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept her.
            With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira,
            where he encounters significantly more resistance from the demons.
            Alongside the Hashira and Corps members, Tanjiro takes part in
            numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki,which they survive by
            narrow margins while also taking losses of their own, including the
            death of the Flame Hashira and retirement of the Sound HashiraDuring
            a battle in the Swordsmith Village, it is discovered that Nezuko is
            invulnerable to sunlight, a discovery that makes her the prime
            target of Muzan, who has long sought a way to overcome the sun and
            thus become the ultimate being. Kagaya forecasts Muzan's intentions
            and enacts a strict training regiment of the entire Corps to prepare
            for the upcoming battle. With the blood samples obtained from the
            Kizuki, Tamayo develops a serum to cure Nezuko, who is kept isolated
            far from the battle as she recovers. Muzan soon appears before
            Kagaya, who triggers a suicide attack to stagger him.
